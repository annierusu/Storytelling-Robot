Once upon a time there was a little bee named Buzzy. Buzzy loved to fly from flower to flower, collecting nectar to make honey. 
One day, Buzzy met a beautiful flower named Rosie. Rosie was sad because she couldn't make seeds. Buzzy asked why, and Rosie explaiend that she needed help from a friend to do it
Buzzy asked how he could help, and Rosie said he could spread her pollen to other flowers. Buzzy aggreed, and he buzzed from flower to flower, spreading Rosie's pollen. 
Soon, Rosie had a lot of seeds and she was very happy. Buzzy was happy too because he made a new friend and helped her out. And thats how flowers make seeds with a little help from their bee friends. The end.
