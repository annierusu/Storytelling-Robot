Pollination is an essential part of plant reproduction. Pollen from a flower's anthers (the male part of the plant) rubs or drops onto a pollinator. The pollinator then take this pollen to another flower, where the pollen sticks to the stigma (the female part). The fertilized flower later yields fruit and seeds.

STORY LEVEL 1: Once upon a time, there was a beautiful flower named Daisy. Daisy lived in a big garden with lots of other flowers. Daisy wanted to have babies just like the other flowers. But Daisy didn't know how to make babies.

One day, a bee named Benny came to Daisy's garden. Benny was a pollinator. That means he helps flowers make babies. Daisy asked Benny, "How do you help flowers make babies?"

Benny said, "I carry pollen from one flower to another. Pollen is like flower dust. It's the boy part of the flower. The girl part of the flower is called the stigma. When the pollen sticks to the stigma, the flower can make a baby."

Daisy was so happy to learn this. She said, "Thank you, Benny. Now I can make babies too!" 

So, Benny took some pollen from Daisy's anthers and flew to another flower. He rubbed the pollen onto the stigma of the other flower. That flower was now fertilized and could make babies too!

Daisy was very grateful to Benny for helping her make babies. She later yielded fruit and seeds. From then on, Daisy knew that pollinators like Benny were essential for plant reproduction.

STORY LEVEL 1: Once upon a time, there was a garden where all sorts of flowers grew. There were sunflowers, daisies, and roses. They were all very pretty, but they needed help to make more flowers. They needed something called pollination.

One day, a bee came buzzing into the garden. "Hello, flowers!" said the bee. "I'm here to help with pollination!"

"That's great!" said the flowers. "But what is pollination?"

"Well," said the bee, "pollination is when I take pollen from the boy part of a flower, called the anther, and bring it to the girl part of another flower, called the stigma. This helps the flowers make more flowers!"

"Oh, we see!" said the flowers. "But how does it work?"

"Easy," said the bee. "When I land on a flower, the pollen from the anther sticks to my legs. Then, when I fly to another flower, some of that pollen rubs off onto the stigma. And that's how pollination happens!"

The flowers were very happy to hear this. "Thank you for explaining, Mr. Bee!" they said.

"No problem," said the bee. "It's my job to help flowers make more flowers."

And from that day on, the bee and the flowers worked together to make sure that the garden was always full of beautiful blooms.
