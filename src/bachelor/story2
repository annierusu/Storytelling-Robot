Once upon a time, there was a beautiful garden filled with vibrant flowers of all colors and shapes. 
The flowers were happy, soaking up the sunshine and enjoying the cool breeze that gently blew through the garden. 
One day, a curious little bee flew into the garden, buzzing around from flower to flower. As she landed on each flower, she noticed that something magical was happening...
Tiny grains of pollen were sticking to her furry body, and as she flew away, the pollen traveled with her. The bee didn't realize it yet, but she was helping to pollinate the flowers!
Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred from the male part of a flower to the female part of another flower, allowing the flowers to produce seeds and grow into new plants. 

What was getting suck on the bee's body?
What is pollination?
