Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Tim who loved building things with his Lego WeDo kit. He decided to build a car with a motor, and asked his dad for help.
Dad said, "Sure, let's start by building the car's body with the Lego pieces. We need to make sure it's sturdy enough to hold the motor."
Tim nodded and they began building. After a few minutes, they had a nice car body. Dad added, "Now let's add wheels and attach the motor to the back axle."
Tim helped attach the wheels and the motor. Dad showed Tim how to connect the motor to the computer with a USB cable, and how to program the car to move forward and backward.
Finally, they turned on the motor, and the car started moving. Tim was thrilled! He said, "Thanks, Dad! Now we can have a race!"
Dad smiled and replied, "Yes, we can. But let's make sure we don't crash into anything!"
Tim and Dad had a lot of fun racing their Lego WeDo car, and they even added some decorations to make it look even cooler. Tim was proud of his creation and couldn't wait to build more things with his Lego WeDo kit.
